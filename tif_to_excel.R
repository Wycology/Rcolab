library(raster)   # For creating the raster objects and stacking  
library(xlsx)     # For handling the workbook and excel sheets

# Create three raster and stack them together

r1 <- raster(nrows = 20, ncols = 20) # Creating a simple raster
r1[] <- rnorm(n = ncell(r1)) # Filling it with random numbers
r2 <- r1 ^ 2 # Simple math on the raster (raising the values to power of two)
r3 <- r2 / 13 # Simple math operation on raster (dividing the raster values by 13)

stacked_rasters <- stack(r1, 
                         r2, 
                         r3) # Stack the raster files together  

# Here I create a function to achieve the job

stack_to_xlsx <- function(rs, filename) {
  workbook = createWorkbook()
  for (i in 1:nlayers(rs)) {
    cs = createSheet(workbook, sheetName = paste0("Band-", i))
    dr = raster::as.data.frame(raster::as.matrix(raster(rs, i)))
    addDataFrame(dr,
                 cs)
  }
  saveWorkbook(workbook, filename)
}

# Then I use the function on my stacked rasters to create a file called myxlsx.xlsx 
# workbook in my working directory

stack_to_xlsx(rs = stacked, filename = 'myxlsx.xlsx')

# Note: The pixels can be too many in case of worldclim data. Kindly consider
# cropping and masking to your study area before creating the workbook.
